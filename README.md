# ai-chatbot
Project Overview

This project implements a simple AI-based chatbot using Python. The chatbot can interact with users by responding to predefined inputs and demonstrates the basic working of conversational AI.
It is designed as a beginner-friendly project to understand chatbot logic, text processing, and user interaction.
